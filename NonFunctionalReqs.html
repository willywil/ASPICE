    <h1>Non-Functional Requirements</h1>
    <p>Non-functional requirements specify criteria that judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviors. These include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Usability:</strong> The system should be intuitive and easy to use for all user roles.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> All data must be encrypted in transit and at rest.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintainability:</strong> The system should allow updates and patches with minimal downtime.</li>
        <li><strong>Portability:</strong> The system must run on Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> The system must adhere to GDPR and ISO 27001 standards.</li>
    </ul>
